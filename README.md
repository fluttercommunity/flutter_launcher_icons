# Flutter Launcher Icons

A command-line tool to quickly generate launcher icons for both iOS and Android platforms within any Flutter project.

**Note:** The tool will replace the existing default launcher icons for Flutter projects and so if you wish to keep them, please make a backup before running this tool.


## :sparkles: What's New

##### Version 0.2.0 (18th January 2018)
 * Ability to add new launcher icons without removing the old existing launcher icon


## :mag: Guide

1. Add dependency to your Flutter project's pubspec.yaml below any existing dependencies

```yaml
dev_dependencies: 
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
    
  flutter_launcher_icons: "^0.2.0"
```

2. Within the same pubspec.yaml file, add flutter_icons config section

```
dev_dependencies: 
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
    
  flutter_launcher_icons: "^0.2.0"
  
flutter_icons:
  image_path: "icon/icon.png" 
  android: true
  ios: true
```
```
#### Attributes: 
image_path: The location of the icon image file which you want to use as the app launcher icon

android/ios: True / False - Set as true if you want the icons generated for that platform to replace the existing launcher icon

OR

android/ios: <icon name> - Alternatively, enter an icon name if you wish to use a new launcher icon in the project whilst keeping the old one.
```

3. Run the command to generate the icons

```
flutter pub get
flutter pub pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main
```
