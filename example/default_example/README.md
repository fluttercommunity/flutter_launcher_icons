# flutter_launcher_icons

A new example Flutter project to quickly test flutter_launcher_icons.

# Using it

 * Open a terminal and switch to the example directory.
 * Run `flutter create .`. This creates the folders with generated code (i.e. `android`, `ios`, etc.)
  * Any files this creates in `tests` can be deleted.
 * Run `flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons:main` to generate icons based on the contents of `pubspec.yaml`

# Notes
 
 * This example project does not generate `web` launcher icons & favicons. To see how to do that, look at the [web-specific example](../web/)!
