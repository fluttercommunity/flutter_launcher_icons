description: A new Flutter project.
version: 1.0.0+1

environment:
  sdk: ">=2.1.0 <3.0.0"

dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  flutter_launcher_icons:
    path: ../..

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true

# Some platforms don't support `flutter run --flavor <something>`.
#  These icons are generated with the others in flutter_launcher_icons-production.yaml
# because we want them to use the default icon!
#  We're using flavors, so a `flutter_icons` section would be ignored
# here!
